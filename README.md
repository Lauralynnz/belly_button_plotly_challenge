# belly_button_plotly_challenge

This interactive dashboard is a full stack app that uses plotly.js to visualize belly button bacteria data in charts as well as displays the meta data on the choosen study particpant.

The meta data for each particpant includes age, gender, location, ethnicity, belly button type, and the frequecny they wash their belly buttons per week.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
